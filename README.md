# Git Hub repository for Online portfolio #

This repository contains the source code for a simple website that I created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. The website serves as a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills and experience in Machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, and a little web design. It is a basic website, but it is a good example of how I use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 to create a functional, simple, and visually appealing website.
